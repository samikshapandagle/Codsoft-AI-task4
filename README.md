# Music Recommendation System ðŸŽµ
This project is a Music Recommendation System that utilizes a CSV file as the dataset, along with natural language processing, data extraction from Spotify, and an interactive user interface for generating music recommendations.

## Overview
The Music Recommendation System leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to recommend songs to users. The recommendations are generated by analyzing song similarities, utilizing data such as song titles and features extracted from the dataset and Spotify API.

## Features
 - Song Recommendations: Get recommendations based on song similarities.
 - Spotify Integration: Extract additional song data using the Spotipy library.
 - NLP for Data Processing: Use NLTK to preprocess song titles for analysis.
 - Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction with the recommendation system.

## Tech Stack

**CSV Dataset:** The music data is stored in a CSV file

**NLTK:** For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stemming.

**Spotipy:** To fetch music data from Spotify.

**Streamlit:** For building the web interface.

**Jupyter Notebook:** For data exploration and development
